# Bank-Loan-Analysis-Report-Project

### Project Overview 

The bank identifies loan reports as important financial assets. This is because they represent the bank's right to receive future cash flows from borrowers. 
This Data Analysis  Project aims to provide a snapshot of the overall banks loan position and loan performance within a specified duration. This will provide valuable insight into the into the bank's lending practices, risk management, and overall financial health.

### Tools

- Excel

- PowerBi - Creating Dashboards

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data prep phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data Loading
2. Data transformation (Data Cleaning & Formating)
3. Creation of a Date table

### Exploratory Data Analysis and dashboard Creation

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. We discovered that most loans were taken for the sole purpose of debt consolidation (This category represents loans taken out to consolidate existing debts). We also discovered that Weddings had the least amount of loan requests, individuals were least interested in taking loan to finance their weddings.
2. Further Analysis also indicated that the month of December registered the highest amount of loan requests
3. We also discovered that we have a higher number of performing loans which will further encourage the bank to provide more loans, and this improves the bank's position and value proposition to their stakeholders.

### Recommendations

Based on the current banks position and functional risk management structure, the banks can provide more loans to it's  customers as we have a higher number of performing loans than the bad loans
